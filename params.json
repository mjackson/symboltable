{"tagline":"A Symbols-only Hash for Ruby","body":"**SymbolTable** is a handy little Ruby class that was conceived from the union\r\nof `Hash` and `Symbol`. SymbolTable directly extends `Hash`, but it stores all\r\nkeys internally as symbols. Any key that cannot be converted to a `Symbol` is\r\nnot valid.\r\n\r\nWhile this may seem restrictive, it does have the nice side effect of making\r\nall keys slightly more memorable and usable. For example, values may be set\r\nand retrieved using any key that resolves to the same symbol.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nh = Hash.new\r\nh[:a] = 1\r\nh[:a]       # => 1\r\nh['a']      # => nil\r\nh.a         # => NoMethodError: undefined method `a' for {}:Hash\r\n\r\nrequire 'symboltable'\r\n\r\nt = SymbolTable.new\r\nt[:a] = 1\r\nt[:a]       # => 1\r\nt['a']      # => 1\r\nt.a         # => 1\r\nt.b = 2     # => 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, because `SymbolTable` subclasses `Hash`, you get all the nice methods of\r\n`Hash` for free.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nt.keys      # => [:a, :b]\r\nt.values    # => [1, 2]\r\n\r\nt.merge!('c' => 3, :d => 4)\r\nt.keys      # => [:a, :b, :c, :d]\r\nt.values    # => [1, 2, 3, 4]\r\n\r\nt.each do |k, v|\r\n  puts \"#{k} = #{v}\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou get the idea. This kind of data structure is mainly useful for large\r\nconfiguration objects and the like, where you want to store a bunch of data and\r\nyou don't want to have to remember later how you stored it.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nMainly just for fun, and because I sometimes miss the automatic and ubiquitous\r\ntype conversion you get in PHP.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nUsing [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org):\r\n\r\n    $ sudo gem install symboltable\r\n\r\nFrom a local copy:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/mjijackson/symboltable.git\r\n    $ cd symboltable\r\n    $ rake package && sudo rake install\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 Michael Jackson\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nThe software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or\r\nimplied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,\r\nfitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
